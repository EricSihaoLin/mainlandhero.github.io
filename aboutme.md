My name is Eric Lin, currently a student at New York University studying Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am a versatile programmer with experience in many modern application languages such as Java and C to the more obscure ones like Pawn. I have worked mainly on independent projects and web development ever since I got my hands on a computer.
