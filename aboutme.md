My name is Eric Lin, I currently a student at New York University studying Computer Science and Mathematics.

I am a versatile programmer with experience in many modern application languages such as Java and C to the more obscure ones like Pawn. I have worked mainly on independent projects and web development ever since I got my hands on a computer. 

I am also a DevOps engineer at NYU Information Technology Community and Academic Application Development team. My responsibility includes the testing of enterprise sized applications such as Sakai. Our team also contribute back to the Sakai community whenever we find something useful and beneficial for the general public.
