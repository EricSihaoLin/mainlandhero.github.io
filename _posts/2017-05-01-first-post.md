Every idea has to start somewhere, and mine will start here...

## What is this?
This is where I share my ideas, current concerns about the world, or my general wonderment. It may contain views and perspectives that are different from the popular opinion (maybe your opinion too). Take everything with a grain of salt. When in doubt, feel free to leave a comment on the article, just remember: no disrespecting other people's perspectives. We can agree to disagree.


## Why do you care about <insert thing here>?
I mean, we should all care about everything that's happening in the world. Sometimes it may indirectly affect you too, you just don't know it yet. If I write about it, it's probably because I'm concerned, interested, or amazed by it.

## You're not qualified for <insert field here>!
Yes, I get that a lot. I try to not act like an expert. I will try to cite my sources when it is something statistical. Just remind me if I do forget to cite my sources. In no way will I claim to be an expert at a topic (unless I am... in the future).
