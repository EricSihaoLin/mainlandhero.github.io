Artificial Intelligence, or AI for short, seems like the latest trend in the technology industry. Everyone wants to hop on board and start researching and working on this new hip trend. However, the industry is divided on its regulations.

# Artificial Intelligence Overview
## Regulation Stifles Progress - Mark Zuckerberg
The CEO of Facebook, Mark spoke out for the development progress of AI. He thinks that putting so much fear in the field of AI development is quite bad for the industry.

In a Facebook live video, an user asked Mark about regulating AI, to which he replied, “I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I don’t understand it,” Zuckerberg replied. “It’s really negative, and in some ways I think it's pretty irresponsible.”

In some ways, I can see the merit in an unregulated industry. Programmers and researchers do not have to deal with the hassle of an over-regulated field. This improves productivity and creativity like we have seen. If you don't agree, just look at [some of the dumb laws that exists in your US state today.](http://www.dumblaws.com/)

## You Don't Know What You're Dealing With - Elon Musk
The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk publicly spoke out against Mark Zuckerberg about this topic. Elon states in a meeting with US governers that AI may be the “biggest risk we face as a civilization.”

Mark publicly stated that regulating AI would be "pretty irresponsible." Shortly afterwards, Elon tweeted that "I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited."

Why is Elon afraid of AI? He believes that if the technology is unregulated or under-regulated, AI could gain consciousness and exceed humans at everything that we do.

Elon predicted that Google Deep Mind will win against professional Go players earlier last year. Google's Deep Mind AI created strategies never seen before, which professionals are now using. More recently, Google's translation service AI created its own general language to translate to and understand its context. Now imagine if all of these can be done by a general AI with unlimited possibilities. What will happen then?
